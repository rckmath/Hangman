# The project

A hangman game written in C/C++ initially developed to a university project from my course.
The game itself is in portuguese language.

# The game

Your favorite old school game now in an old school interface. Find out the hidden word by typing an alfabetic letter and win when you match the whole word. But be careful, if you entirely hang the poor stick man, you lose! (a̶n̶̶̶d̶̶̶ ̶̶̶m̶̶̶a̶̶̶y̶̶̶b̶̶̶e̶̶̶ ̶̶̶b̶̶̶e̶̶̶ ̶̶̶a̶̶̶r̶̶̶r̶̶̶e̶̶̶s̶̶̶t̶̶̶e̶̶̶d̶̶̶ ̶̶̶f̶̶̶o̶̶̶r̶̶̶ ̶̶̶m̶̶̶u̶̶̶r̶̶̶d̶̶̶e̶̶̶r).
